4 horn

TELL
e&c =>d; b&c&a =>d; a&d&c =>e; a&e =>b; b; e; d; 
ASK
c

TELL: duplication
b&b => c, b
ASK
c

TELL: chain
a => c, c=> b, a
ASK
b

TELL: Cannot entails
a => c, b
ASK
c

TELL
a => c, b
ASK: don't exist
d

find a case where BC is better than FC
TELL
a
a => f
b => g
f&g => d
a
b
ASK
d

4 general

TELL: biconditional is working
a <=> b, b
ASK
a

TELL: Infix or working
(a||c) => b, a	
ASK
b

find a case where DPLL is better than all other methods
(~A | B | C) & (A | B | D) & (~A | ~C | ~D) & (B | C | D) & (B | ~E | F) & (E) 
b: is pure -> 1, 2, 4 is true
-> then a, c, d, is all pure so this is true
